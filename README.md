# ML-Iris-Dataset
Machine Learning with Iris Dataset

This Machine Learning model uses KNN algorithm for training and taking n_neighbor equals to 4.

Make sure following libraries are installed in your computer:
  1. pandas
  2. scikit-learn
  3. matplotlib (for visualisation)
  4. seaborn (for visualisation)

Accuracy of Default model (K=3) : 97%

To check accuracy of model with different K values you can replace 'model training' section in main.py with acc_check code.
